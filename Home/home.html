            <p>The town of Speedway was established in 1926 as a suburb encircling the Indianapolis Motor 
                Speedway. While it began as a small neighborhood for workers of the founders' companies,
                it has grown into the "Racing Capital of the World." Speedway is now populated by 14,000
                residents.
